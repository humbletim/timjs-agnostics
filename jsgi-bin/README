motivation
----------
Q: does "/bin/sh + /usr/bin/js == instant JSGI container?"
A: YES, if you don't mind being limited to pure-javascript apps
     (w/o any other sort of IO or persistence beyond HTTP Cookies!)

Q: what's it good for?
A: not sure

install
-------
HINT: sudo apt-get install spidermonkey-bin && ls -l /usr/bin/smjs

* put myapp.js someplace server-side
* edit jscgi.sh to point to myapp.js (MYJSGIAPP) and drop it in /cgi-bin
  (you may need to update JSCLI to point to full js executable path)

usage
-----
load up http://<your server>/cgi-bin/jscgi.sh in a browser
