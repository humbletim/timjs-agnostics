this is just a little factorial implementation tester
pure JavaScript and pure C implementations of factorial (recursive / non-recursive) are explored
$ sh build.sh should unpack the json lib used (see its COPYING) and compile the service exe
you can test the exe is working with:
$ echo '0 factorial [5]' | ./factorial
