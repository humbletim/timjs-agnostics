----------------------------
vdom is derived from the following projects:

 * env-js: original Pure JavaScript Browser Environment [MIT License]
    by John Resig <http://ejohn.org/>

 * ajaxslt: An XSLT Processor Library for AJAX Applications [MIT License]
    by Steffen Meschkat & Google <http://ajaxslt.googlecode.com>

----------------------------

vdom.js is a pure-javascript virtual DOM [also MIT Licenese]

 * Some things are looking like a ServerJS/CommonJS module, but they're not yet

 * it is currently just a proof-of-concept, though should run in any 
    modern JavaScript VM with getters/setters and a 'load' stub
